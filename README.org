#+title: emacs.d

The Emacs configuration directory.

Place this directory so that Emacs can find the ~init.el~ file. The auxiliary scripts used by Emacs is placed under the ~bin/~ directory.

* Convention
** ~straight-use-package~

The ~init.el~ is organized using ~use-package~ with ~straight~.

*** Initializing built-in package

Use ~:straight nil~ to avoid pulling the source:

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package builtin-package
    :straight nil
    â€¦)
#+end_src
